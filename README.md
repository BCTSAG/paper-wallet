# paperwallet
Paper wallets to seed the [Burner Wallet](https://github.com/austintgriffith/burner-wallet) with private keys.

# install
```javascript
npm i
```

# run 
```javascript
node index.js
```

This will generate a file called `generated.html` that can be printed. 

You could also just print out private.svg if you are in a pinch. 

If you would like me to generate you a special wallet design `cspaperwallet.jpg` hit me up on Twitter or Telegram @austingriffith

Good luck!
